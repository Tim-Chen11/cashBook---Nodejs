# cashBook---Nodejs

First attempt at a full-stack project. Show billing book view, add, delete, and account login.

The front end is built using html css, the back end is implemented using nodejs, and the database uses MongoDB. Related frameworks include bootstrap, expressjs, mongoosejs.

Used normal WEB and tried Restful API. Use ejs to realize the dynamic update of the net industry. Try to use cookies, session and token to log in the user. Middleware is set up to help detect logins.
